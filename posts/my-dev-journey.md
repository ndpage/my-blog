# Welcome
Welcome to the first blog post in a series I am writing called, "My Developer Journey." My goal for these posts are to let others learn from my experiences and challenges as I learn new languages, frameworks, and technology stacks. 

# First Goal
My first goal in my journey to become a skilled software engineer is to learn *web development*. Web development is only one of the many areas of software development, so choosing this area took many hours contemplating and researching a quick and effective way to become a software engineer. I chose web development specifically becuase the demand for skilled web developers is exetremely high. The world has been radically changed by the internet and the abundance of information avaialable to anyone connected to the world wide web.

# Conclusion

Feel free to follow along with me as I begin this journey into the world of web development, starting with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 

Thanks for stopping by!
